Socrates has been a major influence in my life. Constant questioning leads to a world full of wonder and excitement. As a professional software engineer, his words always come back to me in the most fondest ways. I started this blog to document these ponderings a while back. Alas, life got the best of me and I never followed through. To know me, you must know Socrates. If you do not, please look him up!

### My story
I am a father, husband, and life-long philosopher.
