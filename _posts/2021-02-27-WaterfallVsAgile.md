title: Waterfall Vs Agile: My Personal Experience
---

Everyone in the Software industry knows Waterfall is outdated and many despise it for it’s rigidity and long feedback loops. How do software teams get rid of these problems? Enter: Agile. With Agile, you are able to be flexible with your process by changing something that doesn’t work and trying something new to increase productivity, quality, and even morale. I have become a huge supporter of agile.

Before I start, here are some simple definitions of both Methodologies. [Waterfall Vs. Agile](https://www.guru99.com/waterfall-vs-agile.html):

**Waterfall Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** - Like a waterfall, “followed in the sequential order,“ where the project development team only moves to “the next phase of development or testing if the previous step completed successfully”.

**Agile** - “a practice that helps continuous iteration of development and testing in the software development process” by allowing these activities to be concurrent with one another. “This process allows more communication between customers, developers, managers, and testers.” It’s important to note that Agile is open to change when it benefits the product and client.

My Experience Waterfall
======
Average Joe’s Feels:

  *As a Software Analyst, I spent a lot of time defining requirements, prototyping code, and testing code until it was time for the “real” Software Developer to take my requirements and implement them in code. Months later, I find out that I still have some work to do with that project because there were bugs found and I had to figure out ways to fix it (forcing myself to relearn all the requirements I wrote..).*

After working 3 years in an environment where Waterfall was the SDLC of choice, I grew annoyed with the amount of rigidity and process that Waterfall forced you to live within. The plus side to waterfall in my experience is that you can really go at your own pace because you were given a good bit of time to figure out your part of the software puzzle. 

This was nice, but the problem was that I wasn’t being checked or challenged by others outside of my “wheelhouse”. In a way, I was siloed and although it seemed comfortable, it was not good for the product and our end users. Nor was it good for our overall team. The huge downfall (pun intended) was that you’d take x amount of weeks to finish your phase of the process (requirements documentation/analysis, developer implementation, integration, testing, etc.) only to find out that one of the last phases of the process found a huge problem. A lot of the time, this is in the Verification and Validation or testing phase. This often restarts the whole process from re-writing software requirements to testing. Even then, testing or development can find something wrong or undoable and kick it back. This feedback loop is way too long. Not only does it slow down the process, but this process fosters unwarranted negativity between analysts/developers and testers.

This is common in waterfall. And after learning about agile and scrum, I got super excited! You mean to tell me that the analysts, developers, and testers can all work together on a scrum team with instant feedback loops? Sign me up!


My First Agile Experience
------
When onboarding to a new team that professed their love for agile/scrum, I learned a lot about LeSS([Large Scale Scrum](https://less.works/) - check it out! It’s pretty cool!) because I was told that that was the agile process we were following. I was excited to get involved with this new process, but I found out rather quickly that LeSS was just the ideal state. The state in which this program was in was far from LeSS. I joked hesitantly with my Scrum Master at the time that we are just doing “ScrummerFall”: A combination of Waterfall and Agile/Scrum. He laughed and quipped: _“Embrace the chaos!”_

GroupThink As A Means To Foster Ambiguity
------
As new employees, we were told to “embrace the chaos”. My inner Socrates questioned this mantra. Why should I embrace chaos? We are here to develop software to satisfy the end user. The process in which we do so shouldn’t be chaotic. The culture shouldn’t be chaotic. Communicating to the end user shouldn’t be chaotic. It makes sense to embrace the chaos when you can’t control it, but this was being said all the time by management. Coworkers recited this phrase many times when they were stressed about the ambiguity that was baked into so many facets of our every day work. I don’t remember chaos in Waterfall. The process was well defined. Too big of a feedback loop in my opinion, but defined nonetheless. We all knew what we needed to do for each step in the process.
