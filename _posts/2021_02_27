title: Don't Go Chasing ScrummerFall
---

Everyone in the Software industry knows Waterfall is outdated and many despise it for it’s rigidity. That’s why the agile methodology has become the new norm. You are able to be flexible with your process by changing something that doesn’t work and trying something new to increase productivity, quality, and even morale. I have become a huge supporter of agile. However, I have yet to experience agile in what I believe is it’s true form. I’m not a process expert, but what I’m about to dive into is just a glimpse of what development teams (scrum teams) feel in an agile world where rigidity somehow exists and where re-defining a process is scoffed at.

Before I start, here are some simple definitions of both Methodologies. [Waterfall Vs. Agile](https://www.guru99.com/waterfall-vs-agile.html):

**Waterfall Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** - Like a waterfall, “followed in the sequential order,“ where the project development team only moves to “the next phase of development or testing if the previous step completed successfully”.

**Agile** - “a practice that helps continuous iteration of development and testing in the software development process” by allowing these activities to be concurrent with one another. “This process allows more communication between customers, developers, managers, and testers.” It’s important to note that Agile is open to change when it benefits the product and client.

_**“Don't go chasing waterfalls**_

_**Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to**_

_**I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all**_

_**But I think you're moving too fast” -TLC**_

Chasing Waterfall In Agile
======
Average Joe’s Feels:

  *As a Software Analyst, I spent a lot of time defining requirements, prototyping code, and testing code until it was time for the “real” Software Developer to take my requirements and implement them in code. Months later, I find out that I still have some work to do with that project because there were bugs found and I had to figure out ways to fix it (forcing myself to relearn all the requirements I wrote..).*

After working 3 years in an environment where Waterfall was the SDLC of choice, I grew annoyed with the amount of rigidity and process that Waterfall forced you to live within. The plus side to waterfall in my experience is that you can really go at your own pace. This led to a very comfortable workplace environment. However, the huge downfall (pun intended) was that you’d take x amount of weeks to finish your phase of the process (requirements documentation/analysis, developer implementation, integration, testing, etc.) only to find out that one of the last phases of the process found a huge problem (a lot of the time, this is in the testing phase). 

This often times restarts the whole process from re-writing software requirements to testing. Even then, testing can find something big again and kick it back. In my opinion, the feedback loop is way too long. Not only does it slow down the process, but this process practically fosters un-warranted negativity between analysts/developers and testers. 

This was common in waterfall. And after learning about agile and scrum, I got super excited! You mean to tell me that the analysts, developers, and testers can all work together on a scrum team with instant feedback loops? Sign me up!

If Only TLC Was Taken More Literally (sarcasm).. Wait.. Were They?
------
When onboarding to a new team that professed their love for agile/scrum, I learned a lot about LeSS([Large Scale Scrum](https://less.works/) - check it out! It’s pretty cool!) because I was told that that was the agile process we were following. I was excited to get involved with this new process, but I found out rather quickly that LeSS was just the ideal state. The state in which this program was in was far from LeSS. I joked hesitantly with my Scrum Master at the time that we are just doing “ScrummerFall”: A combination of Waterfall and Agile/Scrum. He laughed and quipped: _“Embrace the chaos!”_

At first, I was like: _“haha okay.. I guess I’ll see what happens here”._ After a couple months, I realized that many people were confusing the idea of “agile” with “let’s set up the process and make it hard to be re-defined”. To be more clear, the process defined was somewhat ambiguous and trying to change it for all teams was more difficult than it needed to be. Since leadership had a difficult time deciding on the specifics of the process each team should follow, scrum teams ended up defining their own processes, which often led to different levels of standards. This ultimately created problems between development teams.

The rigidity of Waterfall seemed to be soaked into this malformed approach to agile. However, the process was way more ill-defined than the Waterfall I was used to. Scrum masters turned into middle management (process definers) and any time you thought of a way to make something smoother or better, you had to get approval from all the Scrum Masters. Even if you had 4 out of 5 teams in agreement, if one team didn’t like something and their Scrum Master happened to be well respected by leadership, that process improvement wouldn’t be used or even allowed to be experimented with. There was a lot of “decisions can’t be made unless everyone agreed” going on. In other words, they metaphorically told developers to **“Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.''** (There goes that TLC again. Why am I weaving this chorus into this blog? Does Joe really like TLC? Is it just because it relates to the title? The reader may never know..)

GroupThink As A Means To Foster Ambiguity
------
As new employees, we were told to “embrace the chaos”. My inner Socrates questioned this mantra. Why should I embrace chaos? We are here to develop software to satisfy the end user. The process in which we do so shouldn’t be chaotic. The culture shouldn’t be chaotic. Communicating to the end user shouldn’t be chaotic. It makes sense to embrace the chaos when you can’t control it, but this was being said all the time by management. Coworkers recited this phrase many times when they were stressed about the ambiguity that was baked into so many facets of our every day work. I don’t remember chaos in Waterfall. The process was well defined. Too big of a feedback loop in my opinion, but defined nonetheless. We all knew what we needed to do for each step in the process.

**Is embracing the chaos, embracing the status quo?**

I challenged leadership and anyone that would recite that mantra until finally, they changed it. Great. Now we have a new mantra, but we still don’t have clear guidance on things that matter. What was the new mantra to be recited so that everyone would fall back into GroupThink? “Embrace the journey”. Nothing like a lovely new euphemism to help veil the fact that the system was flawed and that ambiguity was high. I don’t think anyone took this new mantra change seriously because it didn’t matter. It wasn’t important. What was important didn’t get addressed until everything was metaphorically on fire. And even then, changes didn’t happen. Hero Developers just got over-stressed, fixed the pertinent problem, suggested ways to prevent this from happening in the future (sometimes), and then went back to producing as high a quality of code that they could muster. Only to be re-tasked in the future to fix a problem they fixed months ago. I’ve seen some of these Hero developers leave, bogged down by their leadership’s lack of decision.

**Developer:** _“How should we deal with these code coverage reports? Should we aim for a specific number? Should we test default getters/setters?”_

**Leads:** _“Here is an opinion. Here is no decision. Now, go and get those automated tests written! Embrace the Cha… uh.. Journey!”_

If you can’t already tell, there was a major rift between management and development teams. The teams want nothing but the best quality code to deliver to the end user, but they were stuck with a leadership that couldn’t commit to meaningful decisions to reduce the chaos they often touted us to embrace. When you would ask to change a process in order to improve upon the quality of our codebase or if you want to recommend setting up a [Community of Practice](https://less.works/less/structure/communities.html) (Which is part of LeSS structure), you get a response like this from Scrum Masters: _“That’s not agile”_ or _“Let’s table that discussion”_. There was a lot of conflict, but no one ever fleshed out that conflict. To reiterate part of TLC’s chorus one last time, it was like the Scrum Masters were literally saying: **“I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, but I think you're moving too fast”.** (TLC)

The 5 Dysfunctions of A Team
------
Why did Scrum Masters and Management do this so often? Did they really like TLC’s “Don’t Go Chasing Waterfalls”? Or was it merely because they didn’t want to deconflict the real issues? I previously read [“The 5 Dysfunctions of a Team”](https://www.amazon.com/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Fable/dp/0787960756) by Patrick Lencioni. I highly recommend this reading. What I learned from this reading is that our management team was dysfunctional. They lacked one very important aspect of a successful team. And that is the ability to commit to decisions for the development teams when they needed decisions to be made.

Here is a pyramid depicting the 5 dysfunctions. [Pic Taken From Here!](http://www.aleanjourney.com/2018/01/the-five-dysfunctions-of-team.html)

Where does the lack of commitment to meaningful decisions fall on this pyramid? One may think, _"well, it’s probably the Lack of Commitment portion”_. However, to understand how to heal a dysfunctional team, you need to work from the bottom up. This means being **Vulnerable** with one another, partaking in **healthy relevant debates** in order to understand the problems, having someone **make an actual decision** after healthy debates, being **accountable** for those decisions, and making sure that the team is **focusing on measurable Results**. All of these need to be working together in harmony within a team in order to have success. 

What I found is that our leadership was definitely vulnerable with each other because they all seemed to trust one another and got along rather well, but they would stop healthy debates with the always annoying phrase: _“Let’s table that discussion”_, or _“Let’s put it on the Kanban for this person to work”_. Since they didn’t have healthy debates that led to commitments on decisions, they also lacked holding each other accountable. Which meant that those Kanban items would be in progress for extended periods of time. This affected scrum teams directly when it came to their many retrospective comments being virtually ignored. Sure, leadership heard the comments, but the lack of decision/accountability in addressing those comments was obvious.

Keep in mind, this is how I perceived our leadership from being on the development teams side. I’m sure there is a lot more going on that maybe I don’t understand or see, but what I do know is that the scrum teams felt the indecision through the chaos.

Ambiguity: A Scrum Teams Worst Enemy
------
In order to have happy teams and good quality products in software, you need next to no chaos. **Ambiguity == Chaos**. If you have a general feeling that you are in a chaotic environment, it could be because your process is ambiguous, or even what is required of you is ambiguous. Think about your own team first, then check those above you. When Scrum teams work well, which most of our teams generally did, and they are constantly complaining about recurring issues, then odds are likely that it’s the leadership team that is dysfunctional.

I recently had an interview with someone and I asked: 

_**“What is the culture like? Do you have people that are resistant to change?”**_

and I feel like the response I got was spot on:

_**“Uhmm.. if you asked me this 3 years ago, I’d say yes. But now we have a different staff and they are a lot more open to innovation and change.”**_

This tells me that sometimes it’s a people problem. When individuals are more worried about their own status and ego, the overall team suffers by their selfish decisions, or lack thereof. Leadership teams need to be successful and functional in order to change the organization's culture for the better. In order to make change, it needs to come from the top. Development teams can foster change only within the confines of the system defined by those above them.

_**“Attempting to change an organization’s culture is a folly, it always fails. Peoples’ behavior (the culture) is a product of the system; when you change the system, peoples’ behavior changes.” - John Seddon**_
