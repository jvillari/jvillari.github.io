Why did Scrum Masters and Management do this so often? Did they really like TLC’s “Don’t Go Chasing Waterfalls”? Or was it merely because they didn’t want to deconflict the real issues? I previously read [“The 5 Dysfunctions of a Team”](https://www.amazon.com/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Fable/dp/0787960756) by Patrick Lencioni. I highly recommend this reading. What I learned from this reading is that our management team was dysfunctional. They lacked one very important aspect of a successful team. And that is the ability to commit to decisions for the development teams when they needed decisions to be made.

Here is a pyramid depicting the 5 dysfunctions. [Pic Taken From Here!](http://www.aleanjourney.com/2018/01/the-five-dysfunctions-of-team.html)

Where does the lack of commitment to meaningful decisions fall on this pyramid? One may think, _"well, it’s probably the Lack of Commitment portion”_. However, to understand how to heal a dysfunctional team, you need to work from the bottom up. This means being **Vulnerable** with one another, partaking in **healthy relevant debates** in order to understand the problems, having someone **make an actual decision** after healthy debates, being **accountable** for those decisions, and making sure that the team is **focusing on measurable Results**. All of these need to be working together in harmony within a team in order to have success. 

What I found is that our leadership was definitely vulnerable with each other because they all seemed to trust one another and got along rather well, but they would stop healthy debates with the always annoying phrase: _“Let’s table that discussion”_, or _“Let’s put it on the Kanban for this person to work”_. Since they didn’t have healthy debates that led to commitments on decisions, they also lacked holding each other accountable. Which meant that those Kanban items would be in progress for extended periods of time. This affected scrum teams directly when it came to their many retrospective comments being virtually ignored. Sure, leadership heard the comments, but the lack of decision/accountability in addressing those comments was obvious.

Keep in mind, this is how I perceived our leadership from being on the development teams side. I’m sure there is a lot more going on that maybe I don’t understand or see, but what I do know is that the scrum teams felt the indecision through the chaos.

Ambiguity: A Scrum Teams Worst Enemy
------
In order to have happy teams and good quality products in software, you need next to no chaos. **Ambiguity == Chaos**. If you have a general feeling that you are in a chaotic environment, it could be because your process is ambiguous, or even what is required of you is ambiguous. Think about your own team first, then check those above you. When Scrum teams work well, which most of our teams generally did, and they are constantly complaining about recurring issues, then odds are likely that it’s the leadership team that is dysfunctional.

I recently had an interview with someone and I asked: 

_**“What is the culture like? Do you have people that are resistant to change?”**_

and I feel like the response I got was spot on:

_**“Uhmm.. if you asked me this 3 years ago, I’d say yes. But now we have a different staff and they are a lot more open to innovation and change.”**_

This tells me that sometimes it’s a people problem. When individuals are more worried about their own status and ego, the overall team suffers by their selfish decisions, or lack thereof. Leadership teams need to be successful and functional in order to change the organization's culture for the better. In order to make change, it needs to come from the top. Development teams can foster change only within the confines of the system defined by those above them.

_**“Attempting to change an organization’s culture is a folly, it always fails. Peoples’ behavior (the culture) is a product of the system; when you change the system, peoples’ behavior changes.” - John Seddon**_
